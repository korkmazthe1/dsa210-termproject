# DSA 210 Term Project - Number of Steps Analysis

# Inspiration and Objective
I have always been a very active person. I've always loved walking, while listening to music, thinking and sometimes just to walk. In this term project, I will analyze my number of steps data, and find out how changes in my life such as moving into an apartment from my dorm, going through stressful times, getting a car, changed my walking behavior and try to get insights from the data about my life's going. 

# Dataset Info
I will retrieve the data from my "Health" app, located in my iPhone. The dataset is extracted as .xml file, containing lots of information, from time to the count.

# Plan
I will first parse the XML files, clean the data, visualize the trends, identify the patterns, and then gain insights, using lots of tools from python.
